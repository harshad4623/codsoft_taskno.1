üìù Task:

For this task, I was provided with a dataset containing information about the passengers, such as age, gender, ticket class, and more. My goal was to build a machine learning model that could accurately predict whether a passenger survived or perished in the Titanic disaster.



üí° Methodology:

To tackle this problem, I followed a comprehensive approach:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing: I performed data cleaning, handled missing values, and encoded categorical variables into numeric to prepare the dataset for modeling.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering: I extracted meaningful features by removing irrelevant features from the dataset to improve the predictive power of the model.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Selection and Training: I experimented with different machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, random forests, and logistic regression. I evaluated their performance using appropriate metrics and selected the best-performing model i.e. "Logistic regression".

4Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation: I assessed the final model's performance on a separate test dataset to ensure its effectiveness in predicting survival outcomes accurately.



üìä Result:

After extensive experimentation and fine-tuning, I achieved an accuracy of 92.1% on the test set. This indicates the model's ability to predict Titanic survival outcomes. I am confident that the insights gained from this project can provide valuable information and contribute to understanding the factors affecting survival rates during historical events like the Titanic disaster.
