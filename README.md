üìù ##Task:
In this task, I was provided with a dataset containing passenger information such as age, gender, ticket class, and more. My objective was to build a machine-learning model that could accurately predict whether a passenger survived or perished in the Titanic disaster.
üí° ##Methodology:
To address this problem, I followed a comprehensive approach:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing: I carefully cleaned the data, handled missing values, and converted categorical variables into numerical form to prepare the dataset for modeling.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering: I extracted meaningful features by removing irrelevant ones, enhancing the predictive power of the model.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Selection and Training: I experimented with various machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, random forests, and logistic regression. I evaluated their performance using appropriate metrics and ultimately selected the top-performing model, "Logistic regression."
4Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation: I assessed the final model's performance on a separate test dataset to ensure its effectiveness in accurately predicting survival outcomes.
üìä ##Result:
Through extensive experimentation and fine-tuning, I achieved an accuracy of 94% on the test set. This demonstrates the model's ability to predict Titanic survival outcomes effectively. I believe the insights gained from this project can offer valuable information and contribute to our understanding of the factors influencing survival rates in historical events like the Titanic disaster.
